        <h1>DjangoCon is a Not-for-profit conference</h1>
        <p>
            The conference is staffed entirely by unpaid volunteers; all
            proceeds from ticket sales go towards the expenses of putting on
            the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buying your tickets early helps twice: the conference organizers
            get a better picture of the finances and you enjoy a lower rate.
            Attendance anxiety is a leading cause of emotional meltdown among
            conference organizers; please help fight this awful disease by
            booking your tickets as early as possible.

            All those little things you need to know before giving us your money.

    <section class="subsection_body">

        <h1>Which rate should I pay?</h1>
        <h2>The short answer</h2>
        <p>
            If you are paying your own way to the conference, select
            <strong>Individual</strong>. If your employer is paying for you to
            attend DjangoCon, select <strong>Corporate</strong>.  This is
            a community-supported conference; <strong>please be honest when
            choosing a ticket type</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Corporate rate</h2>
        <p>
            If you have your own company or your employer is paying for your
            trip (which they should): please opt for the corporate rate.
            Included in your ticket purchase is the warm fuzzy feeling of
            knowing you enabled more students to afford their attendance fee
            <em>and</em> food for the month.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual rate</h2>
        <p>
            If you use Django for personal projects and plan to attend the
            conference at your own expense, choose the individual rate.
        </p>

        <h2>Student rate</h2>
        <p>
            The student rate is for full-time students only and is limited in
            number. Students who have bought a ticket must email us a scan of
            a valid student ID as proof to <a
                href="mailto:feedback@djangocon.eu">students@djangocon.eu</a>
            within 48 hours or risk their ticket
            being cancelled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Academics and employees of non-profits are <em>not</em> considered
            students, and should register at one of the normal depending on
            whether you are paying your own way to the conference (see above).
        </p>

        <h1>What you're getting</h1>
        <p>
            Registration for the conference includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to all talks and sessions</li>
            <li>Free lunch</li>
            <li>Coffee and snacks during breaks</li>
            <li>Free wifi at the conference</li>
            <li>And… a beautiful t-shirt, of course</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Buy tickets early</h1>
        <p>
            Did we mention that buying your ticket early helps the environment,
            cures cancer, and promotes world peace?
        </p>
        <p>
            OK, it doesn’t do any of those things. But it <em>does</em> give
            us a clearer picture of attendance (and our finances). This helps.
            A lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, buying your ticket <em>before April 1<sup>st</sup></em>
            gets you an early bird discount.
        </p>

        <h1>Hotel and lodging</h1>
        <p>
            We strongly encourage you to book a room early as well. We've
            partnered with several hotels to provide a discounted conference
            rate for attendees. See our
            <a href="{% url accommodation:reserve %}">hotels</a> page for further
            details.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that the special-price room blocks <strong>will expire on April 1<sup>st</sup></strong>
