        <p>
            The conference location is an old warehouse, part of the old eastern docks
            of the port of Amsterdam. The docks are no longer in active use, since the
            port of Amsterdam relocated to the very outskirts of the city and
            became heavily industrialized.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still the area is characterized by an amazing set of warehouses and old machinery.
            From the conference venue w'll have a lovely view over the water. So if you
            need room to think because of all the things you've learned at the conference.
            It's there.
        </p>

            <em>Just wait and see how Amsterdam looks during the sunny month of June!</em>

        <p>
            The sprint location is a place called De Waag which is an old castle in the
            very heart of Amsterdam. It is the old weighing house and is famous for
            housing the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons during the 17th century which
            was painted by Rembrandt van Rijn:  The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also the location is infamous for being the first to allow paying visitors
            watch the Surgeons dissect dead human bodies. All in the name of science of course!
        </p>

        <h1>The sprints</h1>
        <p>
            The sprint location will be open for us 48-hours non stop,
            meaning literally that we can sprint until we drop.
            If (when) you drop we have field beds so you can sleep on location. Of course
            if you prefer the calmth of your hotel, the hotels are all just around the corner.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will do everything we can to make sure the sprints will be as fun
            and productive as possible for <em>all</em> participants. This includes:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Running up to the the conference we'll coordinate with
                    the Core Developers to make sure we have stuff to do that's both
                    useful and doable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At least one of the talks on the main conference days will be
                    dealing with contributing to Django in general and the sprint
                    in particular.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For those who are not familiar with sprints: we'll make sure to
                    ease you into the experience on the actual sprint days.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <em>Sprints are going to be awesome!</em>
