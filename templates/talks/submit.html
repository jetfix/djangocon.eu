                Because DjangoCon Europe is a community conference, we want to
                hear from <em>you</em> about the cool new extension to Django
                you've created, the best way to scale a Django project, how to
                make apps that are reusable, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are aiming for a conference with a focus on advanced topics.
                You can assume that all attendees have a good understanding about
                the Django framework and will understand and welcome an in-depth talk.

            <h1>Talk Submission Guidelines</h1>
            <p>We've done our best to keep the administrativa to a minimum, please read the guidelines carefully before submitting a talk.</p>

            <h2>Submission form</h2>
            <p>
                Keep in mind that we have to use the
                information you provide to decide whether or not to accept your
                proposal. Try to explain your proposal as good as
                possible to someone from the Django community, but remain
                to the point.
            </p>

            <h2>Dates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>April 15<sup>th</sup></strong>: submission deadline</li>
                <li><strong>May 1<sup>st</sup></strong>: acceptance announcements</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Speaker Registration</h2>
            <p>
                DjangoCon Europe is a volunteer-run conference funded mainly by ticket sales;
                everybody pays to attend (including speakers). Talk submission is not a substitute
                for purchasing a ticket. If you plan on giving a talk, please make sure to purchase
                conference tickets and arrange transportation/lodging for yourself.
            </p>


            <h2>Talks are Public</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>All talks</strong> given at DjangoCon will be recorded and published online; people submitting a talk, need to
                explicitly authorize the recording and publishing of their talk by checking the
                '{{ talk_form.allow_recording.label_tag }}' checkbox.
            </p>

            <h2>Format Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
                There are two types of talks that can be given at DjangoCon:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Shorter 20 minutes talk: Speakers should budget <strong>15 minutes</strong>
                        for the actual presentation and <strong>5 minutes</strong> for answering questions from the audience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Full length 45 minutes talk: Speakers should budget <strong>30 minutes</strong>
                        for the actual presentation and <strong>15 minutes</strong> for answering questions from the audience.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Talk Alternatives</h2>
            <p>
                If a full-length presentation is overkill for your topic, consider giving a 5-minute lightning talk! There will
                be several lightning-talk sessions throughout the conference, as well as adjoining "Open Spaces" for
                informal and spontaneous presentations. Lightning talks can be on a wide variety of topics! Talk about a cool project
                you're working on, some technique or tool that you want to highlight, or a cool story you wish to share with the
                Django community&mdash;so long as your talk fits into 5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lightning talks and open-space registration is ad-hoc and will take place during DjangoCon; instructions on how
                to register will be posted to the site. Registration for these will be first-come-first-served.
            </p>
