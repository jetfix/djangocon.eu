        <h1>Organising a conference is expensive!</h1>

        <p>
            There, we said it. It's true! A community conference like this
            needs companies that want to support the conference and make
            it a truly great event.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ve penned an open letter to possible sponsors below.  If you
            work at (or know of) a company that is using Django or wants to
            reach out to the greater Django community, show the open letter to
            the person responsible within your company for sponsoring and have
            him or her get in touch with us through e-mail: <a
                href="emailto:sponsors@djangocon.eu">sponsors@djangocon.eu</a>.

        <h1>Dear potential sponsor,</h1>

        <p>
            We would love to secure your sponsorship for DjangoCon Europe 2011:
            <em>the</em> annual European conference on the Django web
            framework, taking place this year in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
        </p>

        <p>
            Django is Open Source software, like Linux, that allows software
            engineers to rapidly develop websites quickly and easily.  Using
            Django allows for smaller teams to get better work done in less
            time.
        </p>

        <h1>The conference</h1>
        <p>
            The conference will be held from <em>Monday June 6<sup>th</sup></em>
            until <em>Friday June 10</sup>th</sup></em> 2011. Three days will be used
            for keynotes, presentations and panel discussions at “Pakhuis de
            Zwijger”.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final two days are organized at “De Waag”. These days will
            consist of development sprints, where the community comes together
            to improve Django itself. The sprint venue will be open non-stop
            for 48 hours; these marathon sessions are incredibly valuable as
            they bring the usually far-flung development community to one place
            for discussion and collaboration.
        </p>

        <h1>Sponsoring</h1>
        <p>
            DjangoCon attracts several hundred smart software engineers
            from across the globe, both in person and via streaming video.
            Support the conference and gain a place in their hearts and minds.
        </p>
