    <h2>Which rate should I pay?</h2>
    <h3>The short answer</h3>
    <p>
        If you are paying your own way to the conference, select <strong>Individual</strong>. If
        your employer is paying for you to attend DjangoCon, select <strong>Corporate</strong>.
        This is a community-supported conference; <strong>please be honest when choosing a ticket type</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Corporate rate</h2>
    <p>
        If you have your own company or your employer is paying for your trip (which he should): please opt for the corporate rate.
        Included in your ticket purchase is the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing you enabled more students to afford their attendance
        fee <em>and</em> food for the month.
    </p>

    <h3>Individual rate</h2>
    <p>
        If you use Django for personal projects and want to attend the conference on your own expense. In that case:
        the individual rate is all you ever wanted.
    </p>

    <h3>Student rate</h3>
    <p>
        The student rate is for full-time students only and is limited in number. Students who have
        bought a ticket should email us a scan of a valid student ID as proof within 48 hours or risk
        their ticket being cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Academics and employees of non-profits should register at the normal rates, depending on whether
        you are paying your own way to the conference (see above).
    </p>

    <h2>What you're getting</h2>
    <p>
        Registration for the conference includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to all talks and sessions</li>
        <li>Free lunch</li>
        <li>Coffee and snacks during breaks</li>
        <li>Free wifi at the conference</li>
        <li>And... a beautiful t-shirt, of course</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buy tickets early</h2>
    <p>
        DjangoCon is a community effort, organised by Djangonauts like you.
        If you plan to attend the conference (which you do, right?) then
        please buy your tickets early, it will allow us to get our financial
        picture clear earlier, which helps the organisation <em>a lot</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore buying your ticket <em>before April 1st</em> gives you
        the early bird discount.
    </p>

    <h2>Hotel and lodging</h2>
    <p>
        We strongly encourage you to book a room at the very moment you book your tickets,
        see: <a href="{% url accommodation:reserve %}">hotels</a>. If you do so you can
        make use of the special price and conditions available to us through our DjangoCon room blocks.
        <em>The room blocks will expire at: April 1st</em>
    </p>
