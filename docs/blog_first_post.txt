# Houston, we have liftoff

We are pleased to announce that DjangoCon Europe 2011 is open for business. [Tickets sales are underway](/tickets/ "Tickets page"), [hotel reservations](/accommodation/reserve/ "Hotels page") can be booked, and [talk submissions](/talks/submit/ "Talk submission page") are being accepted.

## Deadlines

Unfortunately, this year we got off to a very late start with registration—our sincere apologies.

As a result, there are several deadlines already approaching. Notably, the conference hotels will only honor the special room rates if booked before __Friday, April 1st__. This is something we cannot control, and so we urge you to book your hotels in time to take advantage of the discounted rates.

* Discounted hotel rooms available until: __Friday, April 1st__.
* Early bird registration is available until: __Friday, April 1st__.
* Regular rate is available until: __Friday, May 13th__.
* Talk submission deadline is: __Friday, April 15th__.
* Acceptance announcements are on: __Sunday, May 1st__.

## Talks

This edition of DjangoCon will focus on advanced topics. If you have anything in-depth and interesting to present to your fellow Djangonauts, please [submit a talk](/talks/submit/ "Talk submission page").

## Sponsors

Additional sponsors for this year’s DjangoCon would be most welcome. If you (or someone you know) might be interested in supporting this prominent event in every djangonaut’s calendar, please have a look at the [sponsor page](/sponsors/ "Sponsor page").

## One more thing…

Buying your tickets early helps twice: the conference organizers get a better picture of the finances and you enjoy a lower rate. Attendance anxiety is a leading cause of emotional meltdown among conference organizers; please help fight this awful disease by booking [your tickets](/tickets/ "Tickets page") as early as possible.

We would like to thank the volunteers who have helped get us this far; their efforts are what make the conference awesome:

* Joeri Bekker
* Niels Bom
* Jeroen Dekkers
* Wim Feijen
* Idan Gazit
* Vincent Hillenbrink
* Jannis Leidel
* Yuri van der Meer
* Gijs Molenar
* Guyon Moree
* Reinout van Rees
* Klaas van Schelven
* Remco Wendt

We hope to see you all in Amsterdam in June for the third edition of DjangoCon Europe! If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us at [feedback@djangocon.eu](mailto:feedback@djangocon.eu).
