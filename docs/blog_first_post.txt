# Ticket sales online and more

We are so happy to announce to all of you that as of this moment [ticket sales](/tickets/ "Tickets page"), [hotel reservations](/accommodation/reserve/ "Hotels page") and [talk submission](/talks/submit/ "Talk submission page") are alive and kicking! For your information, please be aware of the following _deadlines_:

## Ticket registration Deadlines:

* Early bird registration is available until: _Friday, April 1st_.
* Regular rate is available until: _Friday, May 13th_ (no kidding)

## Speaker registration deadlines:

* Submission deadline is: _Friday, April 15th_.
* Acceptance announcements are on: _Sunday, May 1st_.

## Talks

This edition of DjangoCon will focus on advanced topics. If you have anything in-depth and interesting to present to your fellow Djangonauts, please [submit a talk](/talks/submit/ "Talk submission page").

## Sponsors

W're hoping to welcome more sponsors in supporting this edition of DjangoCon. Have a look at the [sponsor page](/sponsors/ "Sponsor page") if you, or someone you know, may want to become our beloved sponsor.

## Last request

Buying your tickets early helps twice: the conference organizers get a better picture of the finances and you enjoy a lower rate. Attendance anxiety is a leading cause of emotional meltdown among conference organizers; please help fight this awful disease by booking [your tickets](/tickets/ "Tickets page") as early as possible.

We would like to thank all volunteers who have helped until now, and who will help us out in the near future, into making this a fabulous edition of DjangoCon!

We hope to see you all in Amsterdam in June for the _third edition of DjangoCon Europe_!
