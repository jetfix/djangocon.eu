        <h1>Conference sold out, waiting list closed</h1>
        <p>
            As of this moment DjangoCon Europe 2011 is sold out and we have
            closed the waiting list. If you where not able to buy a ticket
            yet or put yourself on the waiting list, you'll have to follow
            DjangoCon comfortably from your chair using our live video stream.
        </p>

        <h1>You are on the waiting list, now what?</h1>
        <p>
            Starting May 18<sup>th</sup> we will start inviting people who have
            subscribed to the waiting list. People who put themselves on the
            waiting list first will be invited first to buy their ticket. From
            then on it is first-come, first-served.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tickets are sold at the regular rate. The night owl rate has been
            scratched entirely.
